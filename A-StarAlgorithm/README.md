<h3>The A* Search algorithm has been used to calculate the shortest and the second shortest path. The algorithm, when compared to other conventional pathfinding algorithms, has better efficiency and accuracy. It is very popular and is used extensively in games and mapping applications. The program is an implmentation of the algorithm using C++.</h3>
